# OQ_networking
Oculus Quest Toolkit demo with networking capabilities

This depends on three directories copied over from external projects (not included) into the project top level:

Copy OQ_Toolkit/ from https://github.com/NeoSpark314/godot_oculus_quest_toolkit

Copy networking/ from https://github.com/goatchurchprime/godot_multiplayer_networking_workbench

Copy webrtc/ from https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-native/releases (release code)

(See the https://github.com/goatchurchprime/godot_multiplayer_networking_workbench#readme for help with the webrtc
library.  There is a signalling method that works via MQTT so you can connect across the internet without 
your own server.)
